# Introduction to Reaction Classification

For now, there we will concern ourselves with four basic classifications of chemical reactions:

- Precipitation Reactions
- Acid-Base Neutralization Reactions
- Reduction-Oxidation Reactions
  - Combustion Reactions
  
 Each classification has some distinguishing characteristics that make them easily identifiable from a balanced chemical equation.  

## Precipitation Reactions
Precipitation reactions occur when cations and anions in aqueous solution combine to form an insoluble ionic solid called a precipitate. Whether or not such a reaction occurs can be determined by using the solubility rules for common ionic solids. Because not all aqueous reactions form precipitates, one must consult the solubility rules before determining the state of the products and writing a net ionic equation. 

In general precipitation reactions follow the overall pattern,
$$\ce{AB (aq) + CD (aq) -> AD (s) + BC (aq)} $$
$$\ce{A+ (aq) + B- (aq) + C+ (aq) + D-(aq) -> AD(s) + B+(aq) + C- (aq)}$$
$$\ce{A+ (aq) + D-(aq) -> AD(s)}$$

 If all products are aqueous, a net ionic equation cannot be written because all ions are canceled out as spectator ions. Therefore, no precipitation reaction occurs.

 Identification of a precipitation reaction from a molecular equation is typically trivial. If both reactants are aqueous and a solid product is present then a precipitation reaction has occurred.

## Acid-Base Neutralization Reactions
This is the general format for a neutralization reaction is an acid reacting with a base to produce a salt and water:

$$\ce{\text{Acid}   +    \text{Base}  ->   \text{Salt}    + \text{Water}}$$

In chemistry we frequently use a shorthand to represent generic acids and bases. HA can represent any simple monoprotic acid and BOH (sometimes just B, but for now always include the hydroxide) represents any simple base. The a represents any anion with a negative charge and B represent any cation with a positive charge. Written in a shorthand notation widely used in chemistry,

$$\ce{HA (aq) + BOH (aq) -> AB (aq) + H2O (l)} $$
$$\ce{H+ (aq) + A- (aq) + B+ (aq) + OH-(aq) -> AB (aq) + H2O (l)}$$
$$\ce{H+ (aq) + OH- (aq) -> H2O (l)}$$

The net ionic equation for an acid-base neutralization will always be the same written above. If the net ionic equation is not the same then it is not an acid-base neutralization.

## Reduction-Oxidation Reactions 
An oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction is a type of chemical reaction that involves a transfer of electrons between two species. An oxidation-reduction reaction is any chemical reaction in which the oxidation number of a molecule, atom, or ion changes by gaining or losing an electron. 

An atom is oxidized if its oxidation number increases, the reducing agent, and an atom is reduced if its oxidation number decreases, the oxidizing agent. The atom that is oxidized is the reducing agent, and the atom that is reduced is the oxidizing agent. (Note: the oxidizing and reducing agents can be the same element or compound).

Redox reactions are comprised of two parts, a reduced half and an oxidized half, that always occur together. The reduced half gains electrons and the oxidation number decreases, while the oxidized half loses electrons and the oxidation number increases.

 Simple ways to remember this include the mnemonic devices: LEO (lose electron oxidize) the lion goes GER (gain electrons reduce) or  OIL (oxidation is loss) RIG (reduction is gain)
 
 There is no net change in the number of electrons in a redox reaction. Those given off in the oxidation half reaction are taken up by another species in the reduction half reaction.

The two species that exchange electrons in a redox reaction are given special names (that can be confusing at first):

- oxidized
- reduced 
- oxidizing agent - by accepting electrons it oxidizes other species.
- reducing agent - by giving electrons it reduces the other species.

Hence, what is the atom that is oxidized is part of the reducing agent and the atom that is reduced is part of the oxidizing agent. (Note: the oxidizing and reducing agents can be the same element or compound, which can be very confusing).
## Combination Reactions
Combination reactions are "subtype" of the general redox classification. They are among the simplest of all chemical reactions. They involve "combining" two elements or compounds to form a new chemical compound.  The general equation for a combination reaction is given below:
$$\ce{A + B -> AB} $$
The phases of the reactants and products do not matter in this classification.
## Decomposition Reactions
A decomposition reaction is the reverse of a combination reaction, the breakdown of a chemical compound into individual elements:
$$\ce{AB -> A + B} $$
## Combustion Reactions
Combustion is the scientific term for "burning". Anything that "burns" is sufficient evidence that a combustion reaction is occurring. Combustion reactions only require that reduction-oxidation occurs and energy is transferred to it's surroundings The transfer of energy is normally in the form heat and/or light. Combustion reactions are almost always exothermic. The most common form of combustion reactions is encountered when a fuel source reacts with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water. 
$$\ce{fuel + O2 (g) -> CO2 (g) + H2O (g) + heat} $$
